<p>Despite what some people say, climate change is a very real, very important, and very dangerous matter. According to the World Health Organization, between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause over 250,000 unnecessary deaths <i>per year</i> from malaria, malnutrition, diarrhea, and heat stress. Poorer countries with faulty infastructure, which is mainly in developing countries, will be the least able to deal with climate change without help in preparing and responding correctly. The issue of climate change goes beyond ice caps melting and polar bears dying, it goes to human lives and threatens the essential ingrediants of life.

<h2>What impact is it making on our world and on human lives .</h2>
<p>Many people think of climate change as something that is coming in the future, and won't affect them. However, climate change isn't a thing of the far, far future. It is already here. The melting of the glaciers and the death of polar bears is just the start of what we are seeing. The melting glaciers will lead to rising sea levels, which leads to many flooded cities and even islands. People are already experiencing much more severe weather than ever before, with many hurricanes, tsunamis, and earthquakes. Climate change is already undermining the livelihoods of many and is felt disproportionally among the most vulnerable people, and it will only get worse.</p>
