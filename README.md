# Hackathon
This project was created for High Tech Hacks 2022 and is an educational website about Climate Change in order to spread awareness on the importance of the issue

Inspiration
Our inspiration came from the world around us as where we live we recently went through something that felt very unnatural. It felt as though we went straight from Winter to Summer - skipping Spring altogether. We were also inspired by pre-existing climate change websites such as https://www.epa.gov/climate-change and https://climate.nasa.gov/.

What it does
Our website has 4 pages including a home page, a what can you do to help page, an additional resources page, and a game page. The game allows you choose whether to either recycle or throw away something. The website's aim is to spread awareness about the issue of global warming and climate change and to educate others on the importance of the topic.

How we built it
As this was our first hackathon, we didn't even know what software to use to collaborate on. In the end we decided to make a Github repository, share it, and have everyone work on individual portions in order to make it work. We built it using html and built the game using Unity in C#. We then moved everything over to w3schools' spaces tool in order to host the website.

Challenges we ran into
It took us a while in the beginning even to decide what to use to collaborate. We ended up settling to us use Github and work on separate parts instead of one thing at the same time. We first tried to use Domain.com to host the website with the free domain but we couldn't figure out how to use our html code without the provided templates. It didn't feel right to use a template as we wanted to code everything by ourselves. Because of this, we moved everything to w3schools' spaces tool. The biggest challenge we faced was attempting to add the Unity game onto the website but in the end we weren't able to as we ran out of time. We settled for recording a video of it and putting the code on Github for everyone to check out.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the every part of the process that we took through these 24 hours. Each part came with a sense of accomplishment even if it was just sharing the Github repository as it was our first time ever doing something like this. We're especially proud of being able to learn along the way and figure out how to overcome challenges using the power of google. We're also proud of the animation on the what you can do page (credit to Spencer) as it was his first time making something like that.

What we learned
We learned how to work together and play to each other's strengths throughout the 24 hours. I feel like we'd do so much differently next time (trust me there will definitely be a next time cause this was such a blast - we're coming for you HTH '23). We learned a lot about coding as well.

What's next for Climate Change Website
This was mostly a learning experience for us as it was our first website. I don't know that we have any major plans to continue with the website; however, there were some parts that remained unfinished that I think we will finish in order to learn even more. For example, we want to include the Unity game and have it be built in. We'd also like to learn how to incorporate JS and CSS in order to make the website look a whole lot better and not so bare-bones. This first hackathon project of ours will definitely be a memory to be proud of in the future and be great to look back on.
